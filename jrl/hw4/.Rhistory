#3 MISSING DATA AGAIN AND SETTING OPTIONS --------------------------
options()$na.action	# the default is to omit missing data (for functions that ask for the default)
options(na.action='na.exclude')	# this is usually the best option; you might consider placing it in your RProfile.site
#2 INSTALLING PACKAGE "CAR"  --------------------------
#install.packages("car",dependencies=TRUE)   # run only if you haven't already installed "car"
search()       # shows all *loaded* packages - "car" isn't there yet b/c we haven't loaded it in this session; just installed it
library(car)   # now we've loaded it (if you get an error here, you need to install the package in your local machine)
search()       # note that "car"'s dependency ("leaps") is not yet loaded - it will load when needed (called "lazy loading")
LS(2)	       # what's in car? LS() is a function I wrote that is like ls() but provides more info
#3 MISSING DATA AGAIN AND SETTING OPTIONS --------------------------
options()$na.action	# the default is to omit missing data (for functions that ask for the default)
options(na.action='na.exclude')	# this is usually the best option; you might consider placing it in your RProfile.site
options()$na.action	# now the default for this session is na.exclude. Recall that na.exclude this is nice because na.exclude produces NA's for y-hats, residuals, etc associated with values that are missing rather than simply not having any values for these elements associated w/ missing values
#4 LOOKING AT DATA --------------------------
head(Duncan) #look at first 6 lines by default
?head #we can look at the possible arguments to hear
head(Duncan,n=12) #we can change the default
summary(Duncan)	# quick summary of the dataset
barplot(summary(Duncan$type))	# barplot of the data; gives the numbers in each profession type. summary() deals with Duncan$type by giving the numbers in each category because type is of mode factor
myformula <- Duncan$prestige~Duncan$type  # creating a formula
info(myformula)			# class = formula
myformula <- Duncan$prestige~Duncan$type  # creating a formula
info(myformula)			# class = formula
boxplot(myformula)		# boxplot of the data - notice that boxplot does a particular thing with class = function
boxplot(prestige~type,data=Duncan)	# same thing
#5 SIMPLE ONE-WAY ANOVA OF DATA --------------------------
model.1 <- lm(prestige ~ type,data=Duncan)	# we've done this before in previous HWs
summary(model.1)		# what do the slopes mean?
contrasts(Duncan$type)			# we need to know the contrast to interpret the slopes! This type of contrast is called a "treatment" contrast in R, often referred to as a dummy contrast.
# The intercept (when both contrasts are 0) is the mean for bc
# 1st slope is difference in prestige between prof and blue collar
# 2nd slope is difference in prestige between wc and blue collar
(mns <- tapply(Duncan$prestige,Duncan$type,mean))      # look at means by type
mns[2]-mns[1]   # look familiar? Check out the 1st slope in summary(model.1)
mns["wc"]-mns["bc"] #we can also index using the names for vectors with named elements. Compare to 2nd slope
anova(model.1)			# think of the "anova" function as akin to the "summary" function - just summarizing what happens to your model when a factor is dropped. Here we drop the factor "type", which has k-1=3-1=2 degrees of freedom (corresponding to the 2 slopes in regression). anova() answers the question, "How much worse is our fit when we use just the overall mean (intercept) to predict prestige vs. when we use the intercept plus two slopes?"
# this is how we fit a model with only the intercept (i.e., modeling the mean prestige)
model.2 <- lm(prestige ~ 1,data=Duncan)
summary(model.2)		# this answers: is the average prestige greater than 0? Not too interesting...
anova(model.2,model.1)	        # this is really what's going on 'inside' anova when it is called as above: if you give anova two models, it subtracts the fit of the alternative model (the full model.1) from the fit of the null model (the intercept model.2); the  (diff in SS) follows an chi-sq distribution [not shown] whereas the ratio of (diff in SS)/df to RSS/df_within follows an F distribution with df 2,42.
anova(model.1)			# compare the F and p-values from this anova and the one above. Do you understand why they're the same? This should help you understand what "anova" does when you give it a model: by default, it merely is  comparing a full model to a model with an intercept only
# aov() is a function for fitting anova models directly
model.1.aov <- aov(prestige ~ type,data=Duncan)
summary(model.1.aov)		     # same as above
#6 SPECIFYING YOUR OWN CONTRASTS BY CREATING NEW VECTORS --------------------------
# let's check out R's 'built in' contrast options:
contr.sum(4)				# if we had a factor with four levels, we'd have three contrasts (the columns)
contr.sum(3)				# here, 3 levels and two contrasts
contr.helmert(3)		# also called 'effects' coding
contr.poly(3)				# each contrast can be interpreted as a linear/quadratic/etc slope
contr.treatment(3)	# treatment contrasts; also called 'dummy' coding - the default in R
# Let's first make a 'helmert' or effects contrast on our own so we can see exactly how "lm" deals with factors
(code.prof <- (Duncan$type=='prof')*3 - 1)		    # let's first manually recode type to be 2 if 'prof' and -1 otherwise
(code.wc <- (Duncan$type!='prof')*((Duncan$type=='wc')*2-1) ) # now 0 if 'prof', -1 if 'bc', and 1 if wc
data.frame(tpp=Duncan$type,code1=code.prof,code2=code.wc)  # make sure we've done it right
model.3 <- lm(prestige ~ code.prof + code.wc,data=Duncan)       # regressing the contrasts we created by hand
summary(model.3)
anova(model.2,model.3)				    # what happens to model fit when we drop both contrasts?
summary(model.1) #Note that the regression coefficients for model.1 and model.3 are different bc we used different contrasts
anova(model.2,model.1)				    # nevertheless, the ANOVA results are identical. Do you understand why?
summary(model.2)
summary(model.1)
summary(model.3)
#7 SPECIFYING YOUR OWN CONTRASTS USING THE CONTRAST() FUNCTION --------------------------
# Now let's do the same as above in another way, using the contrast() function
contrasts(Duncan$type)					     # default contrast for unordered factor
my.favorite.contrast <- matrix(c(-1,2,-1,-1,0,1),nrow=3)
my.favorite.contrast				     # this is exactly the same contrasts we just manually did above
# now let's change the "type" contrast - R remembers this for "Duncan$type" for this session only
contrasts(Duncan$type) <- my.favorite.contrast
ls()					# notice that the function "contrasts" moves objects (here, Duncan) to .GlobalEnv as a side effect
contrasts(Duncan$type) 			# just like above
model.4 <- lm(prestige~type,data=Duncan)
summary(model.4);summary(model.3)	# these are exactly the same; one way done by hand (above); one way using contrasts()
(dunc.means <- tapply(Duncan$prestige,Duncan$type,mean,na.rm=TRUE))
summary(model.4)
#Try to interpret the beta coefficients of model.4 (or model.3) from the means. Why is the first beta equal to what it is? Perhaps the code below will help you understand this
summary(model.4)$coefficients[2,1]
(dunc.means[2] - mean(c(dunc.means[1],dunc.means[3])))/3
#Try to interpret the beta coefficients of model.4 (or model.3) from the means. Why is the first beta equal to what it is? Perhaps the code below will help you understand this
summary(model.4)$coefficients=
#Try to interpret the beta coefficients of model.4 (or model.3) from the means. Why is the first beta equal to what it is? Perhaps the code below will help you understand this
summary(model.4)$coefficients
#8 SPECIFYING R'S DEFAULT CONTRASTS --------------------------
# Finally, we can do this by altering R's global contrasts - the limit of doing it this way is that you
# can only choose from among R's default contrast types. Let's use R's 'helmert' coding
options()$contrasts #R's default for unordered then ordered factors
contrasts(TitanicSurvival$passengerClass)	#By default, we get contr.treatment for unordered. Let's change the global default
options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert","contr.poly"))  # changing the default R contrasts to contr.helmert for unordered factors
options()$contrasts
contrasts(TitanicSurvival$passengerClass)			   # same coding scheme as before, except the specific factors are associated with different codes

#I just noticed that the signs of the contrasts above are opposite of those in summary(). I'll try to track down why - or maybe you can?
#11 TWO WAY ANOVA - INTERPRETATION OF THE ANOVA SUMMARY --------------------------
# now let's look at another type of summary of linear models - analysis of variance. As said before, ANOVA tables started off as a way to compare nested models. However, when we have non-orthogonal contrasts AND/OR we have unequal cell sizes, there is redundancy in the contrast tests, and therefore order matters when testing contrasts (testing contrast1 then contrast2 will give appear to make contrast2 less important vs. testing contrast2 then contrast1). Hence the need to tell the ANOVA test what the order is that we're interested in.
#All that business about "type I" vs "type II" vs "type III" came later, as a time saver, an invention of SAS corp. Type I Sums of Squares = the original (some say only) type of sums of squares. Each subsequent term tests the term in question controlling for all terms coming before. *Order matters!* This is the R default. Type III Sums of Squares = each term is tested *as though it were* the last term in the equation in a SS type I model.
#	In other words, Type II says that the var. for each term is the *unique* portion of var. accounted for by that term. Some experts hate type III for the same reason that it makes no sense to drop a simple effect in the presence of interactions (the SS for the simple effects is what it would be if the simple effect were entered last).
# BEWARE: SAS & SPSS give type III by default. Type I is the R default, and to get type III, you have to use an anova function in other packages, such as the "car" package.. Of course, none of this will matter if your predictors are uncorrelated with each other (which occurs naturally with balanced data and orthogonal contrasts).
moore.mod <- lm(conformity ~ fcategory + partner.status + fcategory:partner.status,data=Moore)
summary(moore.mod)		# anova summary (type I sums of squares)
moore.mod2 <- lm(conformity ~ partner.status + fcategory + fcategory:partner.status,data=Moore)
summary(moore.mod2)
anova(moore.mod);anova(moore.mod2)     # compare these two. Why do the first two terms have diff p values between models? A: they are different because order matters for type I SS. The p and F values associated with partner.status in the second model asks "what is the drop in fit from a model with only intercept versus a model with intercept + partner.status?" In the first model, this question is "what is the drop in fit from a model with intercept + fcategory versus a model with intercept + fcategory + partner.status?"
# Anova() in car allows you to use type III if you want
Anova(moore.mod,type="III"); Anova(moore.mod2,type="III")
# note that order no longer matters (because of type III SS). Just realize that the interpretation of the simple effect here is "what is the drop in fit from a model with all terms except one simple effect (and incl. interactions) versus a model with all terms?" But does it make sense to discuss a model with an interaction that doesn't include main effects? If you think it does, then SS type III are OK. If not, maybe not. Also beware: if you are going to use type III SS, make sure you use orthogonal contrasts.

# repeated measures ANOVA is an issue fraught with pitfalls; I am going to show you the 'typical' approach that is most akin to the one used in SPSS. This works fine for 'balanced' designs (where the numbers in each cell are equal), but it can be problematic in unbalanced designs. Later in the class, we'll cover a couple of other approaches to repeated measures designs with unbalanced data - linear mixed effects and bootstrapping. If you have repeated measures with unbalanced designs, I do not recommend the approach below. These examples come from Baron & Li, 2003.

#  Simulation of data is often a useful tool in statistical analysis - it allows us to know whether our model recovers what we put into it. Run the following code, which simulates a within/between dataset:

# mood is the subject's mood after the study
# subj is the subject number - each subject came to lab 4 times
# depressed is whether the subject scored as "depressed" on a pretest - between subject factor
# activity is the activity the subjects performed in the lab
# drug is whether the subject received a placebo or a superdose of an SSRI
# (a) What contrasts are being used for each factor? If you want to change them, do so.

In a single figure (i.e., change your default back to a 1-by-1 figure using mfrow in par), remake the boxplot such that its order is more sensible. To do this, reassign the "fcategory" in the Moore dataset to be an ordered factor (see ?ordered) using ordered() and argument levels=c("low","medium","high")

#1 R'S WORKING DIRECTORY --------------------------
getwd()				# Get working dirctory; asking R, "where is the default folder?"
setwd("~/Desktop/psyc5541/jrl/hw4")		# You're welcome to change this to whatever folder you'd like
#Read in a script I wrote that contains handy functions like info(x), LS(), and look(x). source() simply reads in another R script and runs every line of code
source("http://www.matthewckeller.com/R.Class/KellerScript2.R")
#2 INSTALLING PACKAGE "CAR"  --------------------------
#install.packages("car",dependencies=TRUE)   # run only if you haven't already installed "car"
search()       # shows all *loaded* packages - "car" isn't there yet b/c we haven't loaded it in this session; just installed it
library(car)   # now we've loaded it (if you get an error here, you need to install the package in your local machine)
search()       # note that "car"'s dependency ("leaps") is not yet loaded - it will load when needed (called "lazy loading")
LS(2)	       # what's in car? LS() is a function I wrote that is like ls() but provides more info
#3 MISSING DATA AGAIN AND SETTING OPTIONS --------------------------
options()$na.action	# the default is to omit missing data (for functions that ask for the default)
options(na.action='na.exclude')	# this is usually the best option; you might consider placing it in your RProfile.site
options()$na.action	# now the default for this session is na.exclude. Recall that na.exclude this is nice because na.exclude produces NA's for y-hats, residuals, etc associated with values that are missing rather than simply not having any values for these elements associated w/ missing values
#4 LOOKING AT DATA --------------------------
head(Duncan) #look at first 6 lines by default
?head #we can look at the possible arguments to hear
head(Duncan,n=12) #we can change the default
summary(Duncan)	# quick summary of the dataset
barplot(summary(Duncan$type))	# barplot of the data; gives the numbers in each profession type. summary() deals with Duncan$type by giving the numbers in each category because type is of mode factor
myformula <- Duncan$prestige~Duncan$type  # creating a formula
info(myformula)			# class = formula
boxplot(myformula)		# boxplot of the data - notice that boxplot does a particular thing with class = function
boxplot(prestige~type,data=Duncan)	# same thing
#5 SIMPLE ONE-WAY ANOVA OF DATA --------------------------
model.1 <- lm(prestige ~ type,data=Duncan)	# we've done this before in previous HWs
summary(model.1)		# what do the slopes mean?
contrasts(Duncan$type)			# we need to know the contrast to interpret the slopes! This type of contrast is called a "treatment" contrast in R, often referred to as a dummy contrast.
# The intercept (when both contrasts are 0) is the mean for bc
# 1st slope is difference in prestige between prof and blue collar
# 2nd slope is difference in prestige between wc and blue collar
(mns <- tapply(Duncan$prestige,Duncan$type,mean))      # look at means by type
mns[2]-mns[1]   # look familiar? Check out the 1st slope in summary(model.1)
mns["wc"]-mns["bc"] #we can also index using the names for vectors with named elements. Compare to 2nd slope
anova(model.1)			# think of the "anova" function as akin to the "summary" function - just summarizing what happens to your model when a factor is dropped. Here we drop the factor "type", which has k-1=3-1=2 degrees of freedom (corresponding to the 2 slopes in regression). anova() answers the question, "How much worse is our fit when we use just the overall mean (intercept) to predict prestige vs. when we use the intercept plus two slopes?"
# this is how we fit a model with only the intercept (i.e., modeling the mean prestige)
model.2 <- lm(prestige ~ 1,data=Duncan)
summary(model.2)		# this answers: is the average prestige greater than 0? Not too interesting...
anova(model.2,model.1)	        # this is really what's going on 'inside' anova when it is called as above: if you give anova two models, it subtracts the fit of the alternative model (the full model.1) from the fit of the null model (the intercept model.2); the  (diff in SS) follows an chi-sq distribution [not shown] whereas the ratio of (diff in SS)/df to RSS/df_within follows an F distribution with df 2,42.
anova(model.1)			# compare the F and p-values from this anova and the one above. Do you understand why they're the same? This should help you understand what "anova" does when you give it a model: by default, it merely is  comparing a full model to a model with an intercept only
# aov() is a function for fitting anova models directly
model.1.aov <- aov(prestige ~ type,data=Duncan)
summary(model.1.aov)		     # same as above
#6 SPECIFYING YOUR OWN CONTRASTS BY CREATING NEW VECTORS --------------------------
# let's check out R's 'built in' contrast options:
contr.sum(4)				# if we had a factor with four levels, we'd have three contrasts (the columns)
contr.sum(3)				# here, 3 levels and two contrasts
contr.helmert(3)		# also called 'effects' coding
contr.poly(3)				# each contrast can be interpreted as a linear/quadratic/etc slope
contr.treatment(3)	# treatment contrasts; also called 'dummy' coding - the default in R
# Let's first make a 'helmert' or effects contrast on our own so we can see exactly how "lm" deals with factors
(code.prof <- (Duncan$type=='prof')*3 - 1)		    # let's first manually recode type to be 2 if 'prof' and -1 otherwise
(code.wc <- (Duncan$type!='prof')*((Duncan$type=='wc')*2-1) ) # now 0 if 'prof', -1 if 'bc', and 1 if wc
data.frame(tpp=Duncan$type,code1=code.prof,code2=code.wc)  # make sure we've done it right
model.3 <- lm(prestige ~ code.prof + code.wc,data=Duncan)       # regressing the contrasts we created by hand
summary(model.3)
anova(model.2,model.3)				    # what happens to model fit when we drop both contrasts?
summary(model.1) #Note that the regression coefficients for model.1 and model.3 are different bc we used different contrasts
anova(model.2,model.1)				    # nevertheless, the ANOVA results are identical. Do you understand why?
#7 SPECIFYING YOUR OWN CONTRASTS USING THE CONTRAST() FUNCTION --------------------------
# Now let's do the same as above in another way, using the contrast() function
contrasts(Duncan$type)					     # default contrast for unordered factor
my.favorite.contrast <- matrix(c(-1,2,-1,-1,0,1),nrow=3)
my.favorite.contrast				     # this is exactly the same contrasts we just manually did above
# now let's change the "type" contrast - R remembers this for "Duncan$type" for this session only
contrasts(Duncan$type) <- my.favorite.contrast
ls()					# notice that the function "contrasts" moves objects (here, Duncan) to .GlobalEnv as a side effect
contrasts(Duncan$type) 			# just like above
model.4 <- lm(prestige~type,data=Duncan)
summary(model.4);summary(model.3)	# these are exactly the same; one way done by hand (above); one way using contrasts()
(dunc.means <- tapply(Duncan$prestige,Duncan$type,mean,na.rm=TRUE))
#Try to interpret the beta coefficients of model.4 (or model.3) from the means. Why is the first beta equal to what it is? Perhaps the code below will help you understand this
summary(model.4)$coefficients[2,1]
(dunc.means[2] - mean(c(dunc.means[1],dunc.means[3])))/3
#8 SPECIFYING R'S DEFAULT CONTRASTS --------------------------
# Finally, we can do this by altering R's global contrasts - the limit of doing it this way is that you
# can only choose from among R's default contrast types. Let's use R's 'helmert' coding
options()$contrasts #R's default for unordered then ordered factors
contrasts(TitanicSurvival$passengerClass)	#By default, we get contr.treatment for unordered. Let's change the global default
options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert","contr.poly"))  # changing the default R contrasts to contr.helmert for unordered factors
options()$contrasts
contrasts(TitanicSurvival$passengerClass)			   # same coding scheme as before, except the specific factors are associated with different codes
